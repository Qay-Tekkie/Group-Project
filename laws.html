        <h1>Nigerian Bye-Laws Regarding Sexual Harassment</h1>
        <p>Section 262(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos States 2011 provides that: <br> "Any person who sexually harasses another is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years." <br> Section 254(C) (1) (g) of the Nigerian Constitution
            1999 (as amended in 2010) makes specific provisions granting the National Industrial Court of Nigeria exclusive jurisdiction over causes and matters "relating to or connected with any dispute arising from discrimination or sexual harassment
            at the workplace."</p>
        <p>Following this constitutional provision, the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) has awarded damages in deserving cases against perpetrators of workplace sexual harassment. <br> In Pastor (Mrs.) Abimbola Patricia Yakubu V Financial Reporting
            Council of Nigeria& Anor (Suit No NICN/LA/673/2013; judgement delivered on the 24th November, 2016), the claimant's case was that she was at various times subjected to continuous sexual and seductive gestures and compliments, promiscuous and
            obscene talks, demand for sexual favours and indecent marriage proposal from the 2nd defendant while she was in the employment of the 1st defendant. The NICN held that the claimant's right to human dignity and self-worth was violated by the
            2nd defendant and awarded the sum of N5,000,000(Five Million Naira) as damages in favour of the claimant. <br> Recently, the National Industrial Court (NIC) amended its civil procedure rules to include provisions on workplace sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>Order 14(1) of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria Civil Procedure Rules 2017 provides that where a claimant alleges sexual harassment in the workplace, it should be indicated if the sexual harassment is; <br> "a. Physical conduct of a sexual
            nature: such as unwanted physical contact, ranging from touching to sexual assault and rape, strip search by or in the presence of the opposite sex, gesture that constitutes the alleged sexual harassment;
            <br> and/or A verbal form of sexual harassment: such as unwelcome innuendoes, suggestions and hints, sexual advances, comments with sexual overtones, sex related jokes or insults, or unwelcome graphic comments about a person's body, unwelcome
            and inappropriate enquiries about a person's sex life and unwelcome whistling at a person or group of persons, any document, material or exhibit in further support of the claim; and/or A non-verbal form of sexual harassment which includes
            unwelcome gestures, indecent exposures, and unwelcome display of sexually explicit pictures and objects; <br> and/or Quid pro quo harassment where an owner, employer, supervisor, member of management or co-employee undertakes or attempts to
            influence or influences the process of employment, promotion, training, discipline, dismissal, salary increments or other benefits of an employee or job applicant in exchange for sexual favours." <br> From the foregoing, sexual harassment
            is not only made an actionable claim, we are also clear on how to prove it in court and what amounts to workplace sexual harassment. <br> Any worker who is a victim of any of the above actions can institute an action at the National Industrial
            Court and get remedies including damages, compensation and an injunction.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Section 224 of the Criminal Code Act Laws of the Federation 2004 (offences against morality) provides that: any person who <br> 1) By threats or intimidation of any kind procures a woman or girl to have unlawful carnal connection with a man, either
            in Nigeria or elsewhere; <br> or 2) By any false pretence procures a woman or girl to have unlawful carnal connection with a man either in Nigeria or elsewhere; <br> or 3) Administer to a woman or girl, or causes a woman or girl to take, any
            drug or other thing with intent to stupefy or overpower her in order to enable any man, whether a particular man or not, to have unlawful carnal knowledge of her; Is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is liable to imprisonment for two years.
            <br> CRIMINAL LAW OF LAGOS STATE 2011 S.257 (b) states that any person who knowingly sends, or attempts to send, by post anything which encloses an indecent or obscene print, painting, photograph, lithograph, engraving, book, card, or article,
            which has on it, or in it, or on its cover, any indecent, obscene, or grossly offensive words, marks, or designs, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for one (1) year.</p>
        <p>Chapter 25 which provides for Sexual Offences states under S. 262 that: <br> (1) “Any person who sexually harasses another is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three (3) years. <br> (2) Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual
            advances, request for sexual favours, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which when submitted to or rejected – (a) Implicitly or explicitly affects a person’s employment or educational opportunity or unreasonable
            interferes with the person’s work or educational performance (b) Implicitly or explicitly suggests that submission to or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in academic or employment decisions or (c) Creates an intimidating, hostile,
            or offensive learning or working environment Anyone uses sexually suggestive cartoons in teaching a subject not related to sex. <br> During recess and/or lunch time, a group of students hanging out in the playground and rate female students
            who are playing/ chatting/ staying there. As a result, some of the female students avoid staying in the playground. In the staff room where there are both female and male colleagues, some colleagues display nude pictures as screen savers on
            the computer; or some like to exchange obscene jokes with each other in the presence of other colleagues of the opposite sex. Staff members make sexual jokes or discuss their sex lives within earshot of other staff/ students on the school
            premises.
        </p>
        <strong>PREVENTION OF WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT</strong><br> It is the duty of every employer to ensure that sexual harassment doesn't thrive in the work environment. Employers need to know that they can be held vicariously liable for acts of
        sexual harassment by their employees and agents especially if such incidences were reported and nothing was done to address the sexual harassment issue or punish the perpetrator. Asides from legal costs, employers that ignore cases of sexual harassment
        pay the price in low morale, decreased productivity, increased absenteeism and health care costs. One major step employers can take to prevent sexual harassment in the work place is for them to include a sexual harassment policy in their employee
        handbook. The sexual harassment policy should; <br>
        <ul>
            <li>State clearly what amounts to sexual harassment.</li>
            <li>Emphasize that it will not be tolerated.</li>
            <li> Set out an easy procedure for making sexual harassment complaints including anonymous complaints.
            </li>
            <li>Emphasize that workers who make complaints about sexual harassment will be protected from retaliation and victimization.</li>
            <li>Set out the punishment for sexual harassment claims which are found to be true.</li>
            <li>Employers should be ready to organize trainings on the signs, control and effects of sexual harassment during induction of new employees and other forms of continuous education to ensure that the employees are constantly aware that sexual
                harassment is a crime that will not be tolerated in the workplace.</li>
            <li>It is also important that employers set up a mechanism to monitor the work environment for signs of sexual harassment so that any slight trace of sexual harassment can be nipped in the bud before it aggravates to sexual molestation.</li>
