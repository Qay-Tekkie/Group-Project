            <p>Sexual harassment is a form of illegal sex discrimination involving unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct that is based on sex. All forms of sexual harassment are illegal, and individuals
                may be liable for this behavior if they do not take the proper steps to address it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SAFE Initiative is an NGO established in 2019 and managed by an experienced team to provide holistic and high quality psychosocial services to survivors of various types of sexual violence. Men, women and children who have either recently or in the

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Q:What should I do if I think I was sexually assaulted? <br><br> A: If you believe you have been a victim of sexual assault, your first priority is to get to a safe place. Then, immediately contact the police or dial helplines . It may
                be helpful to contact a trusted friend or family member to be with you during the investigation into the incident. You may also contact a campus official, such as your supervisor, the Dean of Students, the Affirmative Action Office or
                any other official who can help you. No matter what, reach out and get the help you need. <br><br> Q: What is sexual assault? <br><br> A: Sexual assault is a criminal act. It occurs when an individual is forced, threatened or coerced into
                sexual contact against his or her free will or without his or her consent. Sexual assault may include date or acquaintance rape, sexual molestation, unwanted sexual touching or having sexual contact with a person while knowing or having
                reason to know that the person is incapacitated in some way (i.e., due to drugs or alcohol). Sexual assault is one of the most extreme forms of sexual harassment. A person should seek and obtain unmistakable, clear consent from the other
                person before engaging in any form of sexual activity or behavior. <br><br> Q: If I make a complaint of sexual harassment, will my complaint remain confidential? <br><br> A: Although every effort is made to handle harassment complaints
                in a confidential manner, it may be necessary to provide information to other relevant persons to effectively investigate the complaint. In addition, the alleged harasser has a right to know the details of the complaint in order to adequately
                respond, such as the name of the complainant and/or witnesses to the incident and the nature of the alleged harassment. <br><br> Q: If I am uncomfortable with someone’s sexual conduct toward me, what should I do? <br><br> A: If someone
                is saying or doing something of a sexual nature that may be inappropriate or unwelcome, you are encouraged to tell him or her that you are uncomfortable with that behavior and/or disapprove of it. However, if you are unwilling or afraid
                to do so, you should report the behavior to your supervisor, the appropriate office designated by campus policy, a co-worker or a friend. No matter what, take steps to stop the harassment. <br><br> Q: How do I know if someone’s conduct
                will qualify as “unwelcome”? <br><br> A: In general, unwelcome sexual conduct may be, but is not limited to, any of the following acts or behaviors that are not explicitly invited by the recipient: unwanted sexual advances, subtle or overt
                pressure for sexual activity, unnecessary or unwanted touching, stalking, sexually suggestive displays, deliberate molestations, demands for sexual favors, promises of gifts in exchange for sex, lurid telephone calls, obscene messages
                and e-mails, or being improperly followed or watched by an instructor, employer or peer. <br><br> Q: If a co-worker or supervisor comments on my clothing or appearance, is that sexual harassment? <br><br> A: It depends on the nature of
                the comment. Telling an employee to dress more professionally is unlikely to be seen as sexual harassment. Frequently suggesting to an employee that she wear more revealing clothes as a way to impress the boss, however, could be seen as
                sexual harassment. Likewise, an innocuous compliment, such as "that's a nice sweater," would not be harassment; but if it were followed up with a sexual reference ("it really shows off your body"), that type of behavior would be inappropriate.
                The key is whether the behavior, occurring because of the sex of the employee, creates a hostile or abusive work environment. <br><br> Q: I was denied a promotion. I've since learned that the promotion went to my supervisor's boyfriend.
                Is this sexual harassment? <br><br> A: Not necessarily. This is more akin to nepotism than sexual harassment. If the business exists in an environment where sexual favors are required of employees who wish to receive promotions or other
                favorable treatment from supervisors, however, this could be viewed as sexual harassment. But when a supervisor promotes his or her romantic partner in an isolated incident, that is usually not actionable under sexual harassment law. <br>
